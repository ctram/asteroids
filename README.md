# Space Debris!
My take on the classic from the dawn of the gaming age, Asteroids, playable in the browser! The game is written in JavaScript and uses HTML Canvas to generate the images.

Some fun challenges in coding this project include <strike>having the ship always facing the mouse cursor and </strike>the random generation of space debris shapes. Though, if you're interested, check out the commented code to see what it was about. The ship no longer turns to face the mouse cursor; I opted to simplify the controls so they should be more intuitive now. Fun extras: score keeping for destroying debris, a timer and persistent high score and best time from game to game within the same session.

Todos:
- Persisting scores between page refreshes.
- Ship "lives". Lose all your lives, game over.
- Implement simultaneous key pressing for smoother controls.
- Shooting cross-hair.
- Music and sound effects.
- Explosions!
