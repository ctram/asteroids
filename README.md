# Space Debris!
My take on the classic from the dawn of the gaming age, playable in the browser! The game is written in JavaScript and uses HTML Canvas to generate the images. Some fun challenges in coding this project include having the ship always facing the mouse cursor and the random generation of space debris shapes.
